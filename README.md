# pandas-challenge
For this challenge we were tasked with analyzing a school districts standardized test results. As part of that task I was given access to every student's math and reading scores, as well as various information on the schools they attend. The goal was to aggregate the data to showcase obvious trends in school performance. There were some eye-opening results that were especially important to share after working through the data. First, although one might think schools with higher budgets would fair better with regards to test results, from the data analysis contrary to what one might think...the higher school budgets did not yield better test results. As a whole, smaller and medium sized schools  out-performed large sized schools on passing math performances (89-91% passing vs 67%). And finally,charter schools out-performed the public district schools across all metrics. However, it is not possible to determine why charter schools performed better than the small to medium sized school with the smaller budgets that outperformed the highter budget school. More data analysis will be required in order to further understand if the charter school success is based on their teaching practices or their classroom sizes or another unknown factor.
